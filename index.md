# Accessing your CSE15L Account
To access your specific account for CSE15L, simply click on the link below and login using your credentials:


[CSE15L Access Page](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)


Once you're able to login and find your CSE15L username, you will have to reset your password if you don't have one already. To reset, access the global password change website by clicking the link below:


[Global Password Reset](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/password.php)


If you want to change the password only for your cse15L account and not for your triton link, then type none in place of your student ID.
Once you've got your account setup, it's time to move onto the next step!

# Remote Connection

I actually did not create a tutorial for VSCode installation as i had already installed it last quarter. Once we open VSCode, click on "Terminal" and then "New Terminal". Once you see the terminal open up, you will then want to paste the following code below onto your terminal.
